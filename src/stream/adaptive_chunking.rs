//! Adaptive chunk sizing based on channel occupancy patterns
//!
//! This module implements self-tuning chunk sizes that automatically adjust batch sizes
//! based on observed backpressure (channel occupancy).
//!
//! **Critical Semantics**:
//! `chunk_size` controls **both**:
//! 1. MPSC channel capacity (backpressure buffer)
//! 2. Batch size for Postgres row parsing
//!
//! **Control Signal Interpretation**:
//! - **High occupancy** (>80%): Producer waiting on channel capacity, consumer slow
//!   → **Reduce chunk_size**: smaller batches reduce pressure, lower latency per item
//!
//! - **Low occupancy** (<20%): Consumer faster than producer, frequent context switches
//!   → **Increase chunk_size**: larger batches amortize parsing cost, less frequent wakeups
//!
//! **Design Principles**:
//! - Measurement-based adjustment (50-item window) for stability
//! - Hysteresis band (20%-80%) prevents frequent oscillation
//! - Minimum adjustment interval (1 second) prevents thrashing
//! - Conservative bounds (16-1024) prevent pathological extremes
//! - Clear window reset after adjustment (fresh observations)
