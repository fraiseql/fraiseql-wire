## Phase 8: Feature Additions (v0.1.x patch releases)

### Goal
Add requested features to v0.1.0 while maintaining API stability and backward compatibility.

### Status: 📋 Planning Phase - Ready to Begin

### Implementation Approach

**Version Strategy**: Stay at v0.1.0 with feature additions in patch releases (v0.1.1, v0.1.2, etc.)
- Each feature is optional and backward compatible
- Existing code continues to work without changes
- New code can opt-in to new features as needed

### Recommended Feature Priority

Based on typical production needs, we recommend prioritizing in this order:

1. ~~**8.1 TLS Support**~~ ✅ **Implemented** — SSLRequest negotiation, sslmode, SCRAM channel binding, mTLS

2. **8.3 Connection Configuration** (Low effort) - Better timeout/keepalive control
   - Optional: `connect_with_config()` alongside existing `connect()`
   - Release: v0.1.1 or v0.1.2

3. **8.5 Query Metrics** (Low-Medium effort) - Production observability
   - Optional: `stream.metrics()` after query execution
   - Release: v0.1.2

4. **8.2 Typed Streaming** (Medium effort) - Type safety improvement
   - Optional: Generic `query::<T>()`
   - Release: v0.1.3+ if needed

5. **8.4 SCRAM Authentication** (Medium effort) - Better security than cleartext
   - Optional: `AuthMethod` enum alongside cleartext
   - Release: v0.1.3+ if needed

6. **8.6 Connection Pooling** (High effort) - Complex but requested
   - Recommend: Separate crate `fraiseql-pool` for v1.0+

### Implementation Strategy

Each feature will:
1. Be implemented in a feature branch or main (depending on stability)
2. Include comprehensive tests and documentation
3. Get peer review before merging to main
4. Bump patch version (v0.1.x) when released
5. Maintain 100% backward compatibility with v0.1.0

### Optional Features (Select Based on Feedback)

#### 8.1 Typed Streaming
```rust
// Instead of: Stream<Item = Result<serde_json::Value>>
// Support: Stream<Item = Result<T: DeserializeOwned>>

let stream = client
    .query::<User>("user")
    .execute()
    .await?;
```

**Why**: Better type safety, less runtime JSON manipulation
**Effort**: Medium (requires generic query builder)
**Trade-offs**: Adds serde dependency to main API

#### 8.2 Connection Pooling
Create separate `fraiseql-pool` crate:
```rust
let pool = PoolConfig::new("postgres://localhost/db")
    .max_size(10)
    .build()
    .await?;

let client = pool.get().await?;
```

**Why**: Applications need connection reuse
**Effort**: High (significant complexity)
**Trade-offs**: Separate crate, additional maintenance

#### ~~8.3 TLS Support~~ ✅ Implemented

SSLRequest negotiation, `sslmode` (disable/require/verify-ca/verify-full), SCRAM-SHA-256 channel binding (`tls-server-end-point`), mutual TLS (mTLS) with client certificates. Uses rustls (no OpenSSL dependency).

#### ~~8.4 SCRAM Authentication~~ ✅ Implemented

SCRAM-SHA-256 with automatic channel binding upgrade over TLS.

**Why**: Better security than cleartext
**Effort**: Medium (complex auth protocol)
**Trade-offs**: More dependencies, more testing needed

#### 8.5 Query Metrics/Tracing
```rust
// Built-in metrics
client.metrics()
  .query_count
  .row_count
  .bytes_received
  .elapsed
```

**Why**: Observability in production
**Effort**: Low-Medium (add metrics collection)
**Trade-offs**: Slight performance overhead

#### 8.6 Connection Configuration
More connection options:
```rust
ConnectionConfig::builder()
    .statement_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
    .connect_timeout(Duration::from_secs(10))
    .keepalive_idle(Duration::from_secs(5))
    .build()?
```

**Why**: Better control over timeouts/behavior
**Effort**: Low-Medium
**Trade-offs**: API surface grows slightly

- ✅ 6 phases completed
- ✅ 34 unit tests passing
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Examples working

### Stabilization (Phase 7)
- Performance benchmarks established
- Real-world testing completed

---

## Decision Framework

### When to Add Features

**YES** if:
- Multiple users request it
- It aligns with "JSON streaming from Postgres" scope
- It doesn't violate hard invariants
- It can be implemented without major refactoring

**NO** if:
- It's solving a different problem
- It requires buffering full result sets
- It breaks the "one query per connection" model
- It requires arbitrary SQL support

### When to Defer Features

Most features should defer to Phase 8 or later unless:
- They're critical for v0.1.0 stability
- They're blocking real-world adoption
- They're trivial to implement

---

## Communication Plan

### Sharing Results
1. **GitHub Releases**: Publish v0.1.0 with full release notes
2. **Crates.io**: Publish v0.1.0 (when ready)
3. **Blog/Announcement**: Share architecture and design
4. **Community**: Share in Rust forums, Reddit, etc.

### Gathering Feedback
1. **GitHub Issues**: Feature requests and bug reports
2. **GitHub Discussions**: Questions and discussions
3. **User Surveys**: Gather requirements for Phase 8
4. **Real-world Trials**: Test with actual FraiseQL
